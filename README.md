# Log-Analysis-Script-
This Python script analyzes sample.log to count requests per IP, identify the most accessed endpoint, and detect suspicious activity by flagging IPs with excessive failed login attempts (status 401). Results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a CSV file, aiding in server monitoring and security analysis.
